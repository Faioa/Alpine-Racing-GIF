# Project Alpine-Racing-GIF

This repository contains my work on the test you gave me.

### Instructions

I needed to build a page using the JavaScript framework Vue.js that would display a GIF in the background as the user clicked on a button.  
The number of clicks needed to update the background changes randomly with each update.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```
